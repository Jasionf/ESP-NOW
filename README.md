With more and more technonlogical choices available for smart agriculture ,  Many wireless communcation protocols have emerged . But i find the ESP-NOW protocol can help us to quckily create a greatly projcet , and bettter chocies for environmental scope , where it refers to network connection , communcation distances , and so on.
